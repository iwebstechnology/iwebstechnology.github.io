# Short bio or description (displayed in the header)
description: I’m a web developer specializing in procedural PHP and MySQL, with a strong focus on building dynamic admin panels, registration systems, and data-driven web applications. I work extensively with Bootstrap 5, jQuery, and Ajax-based interfaces, combining clean UI design with practical backend logic. Whether it's crafting CRUD interfaces, handling conditional form workflows, or integrating payment calculations, I build reliable, user-friendly tools tailored to specific needs.
